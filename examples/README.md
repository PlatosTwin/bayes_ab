#### How well do 2,000,000 simulations capture a posterior distribution?

In short, very well. [binary_simulation_check.py](binary_simulation_check.py)
and [poisson_simulation_check.py](poisson_simulation_check.py)
give a visual answer to this question for one configuration each of the binary and Poisson tests.
